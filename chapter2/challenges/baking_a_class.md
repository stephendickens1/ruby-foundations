# How to Decompose or Deconstruct a Problem

[Stanislavski's metaphor](../../../pills/problem_decomposition.ed.md) gives us a vivid and relatable mental image that we can come back to whenever we're presented with a large problem. As a novice, however, you'll benefit from having a clear method for decomposing problems, so let's extend the metaphor.

Stanislavski's cake needed to be baked and the chef, rather than holding all the instructions in their head, used a recipe that even a novice chef could follow.

## Baking a Class

Today you're going to bake some classes and, like Stanislavski's baker, you'll also use a recipe. Your recipe has four steps, but one of them has already been completed by us. You're welcome!

> Below is a recipe that is specifically designed to help you with `PasswordManager` and `PasswordManager2`. In future, for other exercises, we'll introduce some subtle variations on this theme.

### 1. Describe the Problem

Typically you will be given a short statement that does this called a user story. In industry, you may also need to ask further questions to clarify aspects of the problem.

In this exercise, the problem is described for you [here](./README.md#requirements) and [here](./README.md#decomposing-the-problem).

### 2. Design the Class Interface

In a general sense, an interface is where two things come together and interact. You, most likely, interact with your phone via the user-_interface_ on its screen.

Class interfaces are made up of methods - specifically the names, arguments and return values - since this is how we would interact with instances of that class. I.e. We interact with an instance of a class by calling its methods.

> What would the interface for `PasswordManager` look like? Try to sketch it out and then take a peek at our suggestion below.

### 3. Create Examples

Think about what it will look like to use this program, once it's completed, and how you expect it to behave. Write them all down now. For example...

```
# This should create an instance of password manager
password_manager = PasswordManager.new

# this should allow me to add a passwords
password_manager.add("Acebook", "password123")
password_manager.add("MakersBnB", "superpassword123")

# this should show me an array of all services
password_manager.services
```

### 4. Implement the Behaviour

Start to implement the behaviour that you wish `PasswordManager` to have, but remember only to eat small slices of the cake! If you wish, you can use the automated tests to guide you but you should also keep going back to IRB to do some manual testing (see below).

#### Testing Manually, as You Go

As you build the `PasswordManager`, play with it by using your examples in IRB, like this...

Start IRB and require your password manager code

```shell
; irb -r password_manager.rb
```

Create an instance of `PasswordManager`, add a password and try to list the services

```ruby
> password_manager = PasswordManager.new
> password_manager.add("Acebook", "password123")
> password_manager.add("MakersBnB", "superpassword123")
> password_manager.services
```

> If you get stuck, go back to IRB and manually test your `PasswordManager` class to see how its current behaviour differs from the requirements.
