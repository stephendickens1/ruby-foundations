# Planning Your Next Project: Password Manager

In this section, we'll start to think about the next task, which will be to build a password manager.

We'll then derive some learning objectives and work through them in the following sections.

## Part One: Requirements

The password manager will need to:
- Allow a user add new passwords
- Allow a user to view a specific password
- Allow a user to see a list of all the services for which a password has been stored

**We're deliberately leaving out the ability to delete passwords.**

Think carefully about what you'll need to learn in order to fulfill these requirements.

I suspect that the main question you'll have is:

- How will I store and retrieve the passwords?

## Part Two: Learning Plan

It might be tempting to think that you already know everything you need to do this project but beware the [Law of Instrument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument), which describes the practice of using whatever tools one has to hand for accomplishing any and all tasks.

- You'll store the passwords in a `Hash`, which is like a list of things where each item has a label. In this case, the label will be the name of a service, like MySpace,and the item will be the actual password.

- So you'll need to learn about how to create a `Hash` and how to add / remove things from a `Hash`.

- When we come to list out all the services, we'll use a `Hash` method which generates an `Array`. Compared to Hashes, Arrays are more basic lists of things. So we'll learn about how to make an `Array` first, before learning about `Hash`es.

- Finally, to do a really great job of this, we'll need to learn about classes. Classes are used to contain, or _encapsulate_ related methods and variables. Used well, they provide another mechanism for programmers to break up the code into logical units that are easy to reason about and understand. This is very similar to the way in which we broke up the password validator into a number of short methods.
