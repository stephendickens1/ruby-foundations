# Chapter 3 Challenges

Well done for reaching the chapter 3 challenges!

Do the drills first and then move onto the programming challenge. You must complete both before going [back](../06_putting_it_into_practice.md) to reflect on your progress.

## Initial Setup

### Installing Dependencies

You don't need to install bundler again, but you should consider this set of exercises to be a new project with its own dependencies. Make sure you're in the `challenges` directory of chapter 3 and then do this...

```shell
; bundle install
```

**Reach out to your cohort and then your coach if you have any problems at this point**

You might notice a new dependency called `TimeCop`.  This allows us to do things, in the tests, in what appears to be the future or the past and this can be useful for time-dependent features, such as a greeter which says different things at different times of day.

You won't need to use `TimeCop` yourself though :)

## RSpec

Once again, RSpec will be your guide.

You might see this at some point...

```shell
0 examples, 0 failures
```

It means that RSpec cannot find your tests and, normally, it's the result of running `rspec` in the wrong directory.

## Drills

The process here is the same as it was for the previous chapters, but here's a reminder of how to get started.

### Getting Started

1. Find the first set of drills
    * For chapter 3, that's `./drills/lib/1_arrays_and_hashes.rb`
    * You'll find further instructions there
2. Work on the first challenge
3. Run `rspec` to check your answers
4. Keep going until all the tests for that set of drills are passing
5. Move on to the next set
6. Keep going until all the tests for all the sets are passing
7. [Zip up](../../pills/creating_zipfiles.md) your code so that you're ready to share it later
8. Move on to the programming challenge

## Programming Challenge

In this exercise you'll bring together several different concepts to build Password Manager 2.0. 

> Please do a [screen recording](../../pills/screen_recordings.md) of yourself working on this exercise so that your coach can see how you're getting on. You can upload it, along with your code, using the form at the end of this file.

## Requirements

Here's a reminder of the new requirements.

Password Manager 2.0, will allow users to...

- Delete services (and their passwords)
- Track when a password was added
- Update passwords
- Track when a password was updated
- Ensure all service names are unique
- Ensure all passwords are unique
- Sort the list of services alphabetically and by date of password creation

## Problem Decomposition

You're going to need 6 methods this time
- `add`  adds a service and its password
- `remove` deletes a service and its password
- `services` returns a list of all services
- `sort_by` sorts by service name or date added
- `password_for` returns the password for a specific service
- `update` updates the password for a specific service

To improve readability, you might choose to break some of these methods down into small pieces by implementing your own, additional, methods.
### Getting Started
0. [Start recording](../../pills/screen_recordings.md) 🎥
1. Navigate to the `program` directory on the command line and run `rspec`
2. Work in small steps to build Password Manager 2.0
3. Run `rspec` regularly to check your progress
4. Keep going until all the tests pass

## Submitting Your Work

Use [this form](https://airtable.com/shr6mk28x0fy3OrxN?prefill_Item=rubyf_ch3) to submit your code and screen recording

## What Next?

Go back [here](../06_putting_chapter_3_into_practice.ed.md#reflect-and-review) to reflect on your progress before moving on.
