# Hashes Part II

In chapter 2, you learned how to create and manipulate hashes.

```ruby
> # create a hash and assign it to the person variable
> person = {'name' => 'jo', 'age' => 42, 'height' => 170}
> # add a new key-value pair
> person['pet'] = 'cat'
> # add a new key-value pair
> person['job'] = 'software engineer'
> person
=> {'name' => 'jo', 'age' => 42, 'height' => 170, 'pet' => 'cat', 'job' => 'software engineer'}
```

You also know how to get an array of all the keys or all the values using `person.keys` and `person.values`. Now it's time to take things a little further.

## Learning Objectives

In this section, you will learn about:
- Hash methods which take blocks

## More Blocks

It turns out that pretty much all the array methods which take blocks can also be called on hashes, but there is one key difference. Try this...

```ruby
> person = {'name' => 'jo', 'age' => 42, 'height' => 170}
> person.each { |key_value_pair| puts "key value pair: " + key_value_pair }
```

When you iterate over a hash, you're iterating over all the key-value pairs and each one is passed to the block as a two element array.

It's possible to _deconstruct_ the key-value pairs as they're passed into the block and create a separate variable for each one, like this...

```ruby
> person = {'name' => 'jo', 'age' => 42, 'height' => 170}
> person.each { |key, value| puts "key: " + key + " value: " + value  }
```

Note how there are now two block variables `|key, value|`.  As before, you can use any name you like, but it's helpful to other developers (and your future self) if you choose something descriptive.

## Now Try These

The syntax for all these methods is basically the same, but the return values will be different. Try them out now on a hash of your own design.

- `select`
- `all?`
- `any?`
- `filter`
- `reject`

## Map and Each

Both `map` and `each` also work with hashes. Try them out as well :)

## Reflect and Review

In this section, we dug a bit deeper into Hashes.

**Please pause at this point to reflect and review your learning...**

Write some short notes, or talk to a peer, about:
- What blocks are (again)
- How blocks used with Hash methods are different to those used with Array methods
- How you can access both the keys and values inside the block
